simple-css
==========

Simple.css is my attempt at the least amount of CSS (in addition to the browser default styles) needed to maximize the readability (clarity and economy of display) of English language web documents on both desktop and mobile devices.

HTML Requirements
-----------------

This should be in the head section:

    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"&gt;

The body content of the page should be in a div with class "article."

    &lt;div class="article"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Or the CSS selectors should be changed appropriately.
